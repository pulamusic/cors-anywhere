      <p><em>If the protocol is omitted, it defaults to http (https if port 443 is specified.</em></p>
      <p>Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.</p>
      <p>Redirects are automatically followed. For debugging purposes, each followed redirect results in the addition of a X-CORS-Redirect-n header, where n starts at 1. These headers are not accessible by the XMLHttpRequest API. After 5 redirects, redirects are not followed any more. The redirect response is sent back to the browser, which can choose to follow the redirect (handled automatically by the browser).</p>
      <p>The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header. The final URL, after following all redirects, is available in the X-Final-URL response header.</p>
      <p>To prevent the use of the proxy for casual browsing, the API requires either the Origin or the X-Requested-With header to be set. To avoid unnecessary preflight (OPTIONS) requests, it's recommended to not manually set these headers in your code.</p>
